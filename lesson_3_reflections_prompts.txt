1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local?
     When i need to save my progress on the cloud, maybe if i work on my laptop
    localy and this die, i will lose all my work

2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Because maybe my local changes will be removed.

3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
    you use one instead of another?
     This is very extense.

4 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
    stored locally?
     To check if there is a new version.

5 - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
    and what would be harder?
     With others platforms but won't be easy combibe the code.

6 - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
    directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
     When you want to make a new feature or fix a bug and first check if the 
    code runs well.
